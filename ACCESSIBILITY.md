# Accessibility Summary: Konmashi MVP

## Improvements Implemented

- **Form Labels & ARIA:**
  - All form fields in onboarding and authentication flows have associated `<label>` elements and appropriate `htmlFor` attributes.
  - Error messages use `role="alert"` for immediate screen reader announcement.

- **Keyboard Navigation & Focus:**
  - All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs, checkboxes) are accessible via keyboard (Tab/Shift+Tab).
  - Focus indicators are visible and styled for clarity.

- **Color Contrast:**
  - Design system uses OKLCH color space and CSS variables for accessible color contrast in both light and dark modes.
  - Verified with browser-based tools (e.g., axe, Lighthouse) for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

- **Screen Reader Support:**
  - Semantic HTML and ARIA roles ensure all forms and error states are accessible to screen readers.
  - Custom components (e.g., Checkbox) are built on accessible primitives (Radix UI).

- **Accessibility Testing:**
  - Onboarding and authentication flows tested with axe and Lighthouse for accessibility violations.

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

- Some advanced widgets (e.g., custom dropdowns, modals) may require further ARIA roles or keyboard handling for full accessibility.
- Ongoing testing is recommended as new features are added.
- Accessibility documentation should be updated with each major UI change.
