# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Konmashi MVP

## 1. Goal, Objective and Context

### Goal:
The primary goal of Konmashi is to empower creators, businesses, and agencies to effortlessly master their digital content strategy and execution by providing an intelligent, AI-powered SaaS platform. Konmashi aims to serve as a virtual "AI content management team," making sophisticated, multi-platform content marketing accessible and manageable for users regardless of their prior expertise or team size.

### Objective:
Konmashi's core objective is to transform the content marketing lifecycle â€“ from ideation and brand-aligned creation through to multi-channel publishing and performance analysis. It will achieve this by:

- Simplifying and automating complex content creation tasks (text, image, video).
- Ensuring deep personalization and brand consistency through AI that learns and adapts to each tenant's unique vision and mission.
- Providing tools and workflows that amplify user capabilities, making them feel "superhuman" in their ability to generate high volumes of diverse, high-quality content.
- Offering an integrated, intuitive user experience that is powerful yet not overwhelming.

### Context:
Konmashi operates in a rapidly evolving digital landscape where the demand for fresh, engaging, and multi-platform content is continuously increasing. Many individuals and organizations struggle with the time, cost, and expertise required to meet these demands effectively. Existing tools may be fragmented or require significant learning curves. Konmashi intends to address these challenges by offering a unified, intelligent platform that combines advanced AI generation capabilities with strategic planning, workflow automation, and adaptive learning, tailored to each user's brand. The initial focus will be on delivering a robust Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that validates core content generation, simplified workflows, and initial learning capabilities.

**Publishing Platform Update**: Publishing connections for Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Pinterest are currently in final testing and will be available for the MVP launch.

## 3. Non Functional Requirements (MVP)

### Usability:
- The system shall be perceived by its target users (Solopreneurs, SMBs, Agency Professionals) as "easy to use" and "intuitive" for core MVP workflows. This will be validated through user feedback and usability testing (e.g., aiming for a System Usability Scale (SUS) score above a defined target like 70).
- The user interface shall embody a "cool, modern" aesthetic and provide a sense of empowerment and efficiency (the "superhuman capabilities" feeling), without overwhelming new users encountering the MVP features.
- The initial onboarding process for core MVP features shall be simple, clear, and effectively guide users to achieve their first successful content generation.

### Performance:
- Core AI content generation tasks for the MVP (e.g., generating a text-based social post, a simple image with caption) shall complete within a timeframe that feels responsive and efficient to the user (specific target times to be benchmarked, e.g., typically under 30-60 seconds for simple tasks).
- The user interface shall load and respond to user interactions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) promptly, adhering to generally accepted web performance standards.

### Reliability:
- The core MVP functionalities (brand input, idea capture, defined content type generation, basic scheduling, feedback loop) shall be consistently available and operate without frequent failures or errors.
- User data, including brand identity elements and ideas stored in the Ideabank, shall be persistently and reliably stored and retrieved.

### Security:
- User authentication mechanisms for accessing the Konmashi platform shall be secure.
- Tenant-specific data (brand information, generated content, ideas, etc.) shall be logically isolated and protected to prevent unauthorized access by other tenants.
- The management of tenant authentication tokens for social media platforms shall follow security best practices and platform requirements.

### Content Quality (AI Output - MVP Level):
- AI-generated content within the MVP shall demonstrate a foundational level of adherence and relevance to the tenant-defined brand identity elements (e.g., voice, tone, key themes).
- The MVP's iterative feedback loop for the selected content type (e.g., images) shall result in a noticeable improvement in content quality or alignment based on specific user feedback.

### Scalability (Foundational for MVP):
- The MVP's architecture shall be developed using technologies and practices (e.g., NextJS, Supabase, Vercel/cloud hosting) that provide a foundation for future scalability in terms of user load, data volume, and feature expansion.

## 4. User Interaction and Design Goals

### Overall Vision & Experience:
- **Desired Look and Feel**: The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for Konmashi should be perceived as "clean, modern, simple, and intuitive." It must be "cool, useful, and easy to use."
- **Core User Experience**: The platform should evoke a feeling of "superhuman capabilities" by amplifying user efforts in content creation and management, yet it must achieve this without overwhelming users, particularly during their initial interactions and for core MVP workflows.
- **Brandability**: The platform should offer capabilities for tenants (particularly premium or agency accounts) to "brand it a bit to feel like their own." This could involve aspects like logo placement, theme color adjustments, or custom domains, enhancing the agency's value proposition to their clients.

### Key Interaction Paradigms:
- **Conversational AI Interaction**: A primary method for initiating tasks and making requests will be through a natural language chat interface with the Orchestrator AI, designed for "easy button" simplicity and complex task delegation.
- **Visual Planning & Workflow Management**: Interactive Calendar, Ideabank Kanban, Content Lifecycle Kanban, "Subway Map" Workflow Visualization, and Task-Based Management.
- **Iterative Feedback & Refinement**: For AI-generated content, users will interact through feedback loops, including rating systems, comments, and potentially direct editing tools.

### Core Screens/Views (Conceptual for MVP):
- Login/Authentication Screen
- Main Dashboard / Command Center
- Ideabank View
- Content Lifecycle Kanban View
- Content Calendar View
- Content Review & Simple Edit Interface
- Basic Settings Page (including Privacy Policy and Terms of Service links)
